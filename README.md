# CustomSwipeModal

In this task, I have used Animated.View and Animated.timing to create SwipeModal component. <br />
The SwipeModal component accepts the following props: <br />
isVisible: A boolean value indicating whether the modal is visible or not. <br />
onClose: A function to be called when the modal is closed. The function receives a string argument indicating the direction from which the modal was closed. <br />
direction: A string value indicating the direction from which the modal should open. Valid values are: "top", "bottom", "left" and "right". <br />
children: The content to be rendered inside the modal. <br />
